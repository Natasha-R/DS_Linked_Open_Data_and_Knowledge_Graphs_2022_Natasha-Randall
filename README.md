# DS_Linked_Open_Data_and_Knowledge_Graphs_2022_Natasha-Randall
This repository contains the final project of the course 
["Linked Open Data and Knowledge Graphs"](https://digital-sciences.de/en/modules/linked-open-data-and-knowledge-graphs/) under the Digital Sciences Master's Degree at TH Köln.

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to explore the creation of disease-symptom association health knowledge graphs from three datasets, and the feasibility of combining them into a single encompassing health knowledge graph.

This project was inspired by the paper: Rotmensch et al., 2017. Learning a health knowledge graph from electronic medical records. Scientific reports, 7(1), 1-11.

The three datasets were:
1. Disease-symptom co-ocurrences in medical journal papers from PubMed. *Associated paper: Zhou, X., Menche, J., Barabási, AL. et al. Human symptoms–disease network. Nat Commun 5, 4212 (2014). https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5212.* Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.
2. Disease entities and their dbo:symptom property in DBPedia.  (https://www.dbpedia.org/).  GNU General Public License.
3. Patient disease diagnosis and symptom reports at a New York Hospital. *Associated paper: Wang X, Chused A, Elhadad N, Friedman C, Markatou M. Automated knowledge acquisition from clinical narrative reports. AMIA Annu Symp Proc. 2008 Nov 6;2008:783-7.*
